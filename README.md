SAMALEN AI â€“ Tanzaniaâ€™s First Homegrown AI Innovation

SAMALEN AI is the very first artificial intelligence bot built from scratch by SAMALEN TV, proudly founded by Samuel Efrem Mosha, C.E.O of SAMALEN TV. Born right here in Tanzania â€“ and possibly the very first of its kind in Africa â€“ SAMALEN AI represents a bold step into the future of technology for our nation and continent.

This AI is free for everyone to use, because we believe that technology should be accessible, not limited. Weâ€™ve invested in its development for you â€“ but weâ€™re just getting started. SAMALEN AI is still in its early learning stages, improving every day as it interacts with people. With your contribution, feedback, and support, we can make it smarter, faster, and more powerful â€“ a true African innovation leading the global AI conversation.

Weâ€™re inviting developers, innovators, and tech enthusiasts from Tanzania, Africa, and beyond to join us in shaping SAMALEN AI into the best it can be. Together, we can put Tanzania on the global AI map and prove that groundbreaking technology can come from our soil.
